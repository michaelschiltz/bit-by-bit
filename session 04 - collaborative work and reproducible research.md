### Collaboration and openness as a paradigm
* [Linus's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus%27s_Law): "Given enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow".
* open source and open access
* [crowdsourcing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crowdsourcing) and the [success of wikipedia](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2004/oct/26/g2.onlinesupplement)
* importantly, and possibly counterintuitively, openness and transparancy have become a means for [incentivizing quality](http://www.zdnet.com/article/coverity-finds-open-source-software-quality-better-than-proprietary-code/) rather than sloppiness; however, note [predatory open access publishing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predatory_open_access_publishing)

#### Tools and packages
* general: [Github](www.github.com)
  * Perkel, Jeffrey. 2016. “Democratic Databases: Science on GitHub.” *Nature News* 538 (7623): 127. doi:10.1038/538127a.
  * [Why we need a GitHub for science](http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/future_tense/2017/04/we_need_a_github_for_academic_research.html)
  * and [why don't you try out for yourself](https://try.github.io/)?
* **collaborative writing**: [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/), [ShareLatex](https://www.sharelatex.com/); also, note the existence of the [ctan](https://www.ctan.org/)-pages, a library for packages you may need to install when using LaTex. 
* [Authorea](https://www.authorea.com/) for collaborative writing
* these days, google docs too has a nice LaTex (or more accurately, MathJax) integration: [Auto-LaTeX-equations](https://sites.google.com/site/autolatexequations/)
* [knitr](https://yihui.name/knitr/) with R and Latex: "The <strong>knitr</strong> package was designed to be a transparent engine for dynamic report generation with R, solve some long-standing problems in Sweave, and combine features in other add-on packages into one package (<strong>knitr</strong> &asymp; Sweave + cacheSweave + pgfSweave + weaver <code>animation::saveLatex</code> + <code>R2HTML::RweaveHTML</code> + <code>highlight::HighlightWeaveLatex</code> + 0.2 * brew + 0.1 * SweaveListingUtils + more)."
* comparable to the aforementioned Ctan-pages, there exists a library for R-packages, which is called [Cran](https://cran.r-project.org).
* [Julia](https://julialang.org/) and [Weave.jl](https://github.com/mpastell/Weave.jl): is this the 'dynamic documents' of the (immediate) future?
* **data sharing**: [figshare](https://figshare.com/), [zenodo](https://www.zenodo.org/), and [Dryad](https://datadryad.org/)
* as an important player, [Nature has started to take reproducability very seriously](https://www.nature.com/news/announcement-towards-greater-reproducibility-for-life-sciences-research-in-nature-1.22062?WT.mc_id=TWT_NatureNews&sf84509261=1).
