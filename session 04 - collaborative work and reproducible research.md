* general: (Github)[www.github.com]
* collaborative writing: (Overleaf)[https://www.overleaf.com/], (ShareLatex)[https://www.sharelatex.com/] 
* (knitr)[https://yihui.name/knitr/] with R and Latex: The <strong>knitr</strong> package was designed to be a transparent engine for dynamic report generation with R, solve some long-standing problems in Sweave, and combine features in other add-on packages into one package (<strong>knitr</strong> &asymp; Sweave + cacheSweave + pgfSweave + weaver <code>animation::saveLatex</code> + <code>R2HTML::RweaveHTML</code> + <code>highlight::HighlightWeaveLatex</code> + 0.2 * brew + 0.1 * SweaveListingUtils + more).
