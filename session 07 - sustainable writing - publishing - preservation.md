### General/Introduction: The Impermanence of Digital Information

* the leniency and flexibility of digital information is at the same time a threat to its longevity
* "[bit rot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_rot)"; is '[emulation](https://doi.org/10.2218/ijdc.v2i2.35)' the solution? Example: [docker](https://www.docker.com/)-containers (+ [how they are different from virtual machines](https://www.docker.com/what-container)).
* [digital black hole](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/feb/16/digital-black-hole-delete-memories-information-lost-google-vint-cerf) (Vincent Cerf)
* for an idea of the scope of the challenges we are facing, check the [Museum of Obsolete Media](http://www.obsoletemedia.org/) and discussions about [digital obsolescence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_obsolescence) -apparently, what has been a feature of the digital revolution has also turned out to be a bug...
* on the researcher-level: how to guarantee the readability of publications in the future, including in the very long run? Will complex mark-up (html, xml) still be comprehensible, if not to machines, then [to the human eye](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax#philosophy)?
 
#### Tools and Languages

* the traditional workhorse for writing and editing: Latex
  * [the many flavours of Tex](https://www.overleaf.com/blog/500-whats-in-a-name-a-guide-to-the-many-flavours-of-tex#.WnwrBEAHJOc.twitter): Tex, LaTeX, pdfTex, [XeLatex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XeTeX) (XeTex)), [LuaTex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LuaTeX), [ConText](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ConTeXt).
  * you will love the [Bates' Latex Manual](https://www.bates.edu/mathematics/resources/latex-manual/).
* the pros and cons of LaTex: a (tentative) [comparison with markdown](http://jabranham.com/blog/2015/09/rmarkdown-vs-latex/)
