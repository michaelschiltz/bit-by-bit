### General/Introduction: The Impermanence of Digital Information
* the leniency and flexibility of digital information is at the same time a threat to its longevity

* [digital black hole](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/feb/16/digital-black-hole-delete-memories-information-lost-google-vint-cerf) (Vincent Cerf)
* for an idea of the scope of the challenges we are facing, check the [Museum of Obsolete Media](http://www.obsoletemedia.org/) and discussions about [digital obsolescence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_obsolescence) -apparently, what has been a feature of the digital revolution has also turned out to be a bug...
* on the researcher-level: how to guarantee the readability of publications in the future, including in the very long run? Will complex mark-up (html, xml) still be comprehensible, if not to machines, then [to the human eye](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax#philosophy)?
